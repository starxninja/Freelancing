# COMP11124: Object Oriented Programming  
## Week 8 Assignment â€“ Data Structures, Abstract Classes, Priority Tasks, SOLID, Exception Handling

---

**Introduction:**  
The present week assignment is the in-depth examination of the advanced Python programming, namely, data structures, abstract classes, and the SOLID principles. You will apply both abstract base classes and the use of dictionaries as a histogram in order to recreate a dice simulation, and enshrine your knowledge regarding the concept of inheritance and data establishment. The priority of tasks is provided by the addition of PriorityTask type to the ToDoApp, illustrating the Open/Closed Principle. Abstract base classes to tasks and DAOs will also be incorporated promoting common interfaces and sound design. The emphasis is placed on exception handling, and the user is informed of the failure to input proper data and file errors. The assignment will help you become a modular and maintainable coder who uses some unusual names of variables and prints. By this week you will be able to get practical experience of using abstract classes, data structure and working with SOLID compliant design. These are requirements in developing scalable reliable applications. The assignments also train you in interviews and technical challenges in software engineering. You will know how to test, debug and extend your code. The prospect of best practices and clarity orientation will enable you to move towards a better developer and professional.

## Exercise 1: Dice Simulation and Histogram

**Introduction:**  
In this exercise, a dice simulation has been made by using abstract base classes and histograms stored as dictionaries. You will develop a Dice abstract class, SixSidedDice as well as TenSidedDice as its subclasses and a method to find the frequencies after a roll using histogram.

```python
# lab_week_8.py
import random
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod
from collections import Counter

class Dice(ABC):
    def __init__(self):
        self.face = None
    @abstractmethod
    def roll(self):
        pass

class SixSidedDice(Dice):
    def roll(self):
        self.face = random.randint(1, 6)
        return self.face

class TenSidedDice(Dice):
    def roll(self):
        self.face = random.randint(1, 10)
        return self.face

def print_histogram(rolls, sides):
    counts = Counter(rolls)
    print("Roll Histogram:")
    for i in range(1, sides + 1):
        stars = '*' * (counts[i] // 10)
        print(f"{i}: {stars} ({counts[i]})")

def run_dice_simulation():
    print("[DiceSim] Rolling six-sided dice 1000 times...")
    six_dice = SixSidedDice()
    six_rolls = [six_dice.roll() for _ in range(1000)]
    print_histogram(six_rolls, 6)
    print("\n[DiceSim] Rolling ten-sided dice 1000 times...")
    ten_dice = TenSidedDice()
    ten_rolls = [ten_dice.roll() for _ in range(1000)]
    print_histogram(ten_rolls, 10)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    run_dice_simulation()
```

**Sample Output:**
```
[DiceSim] Rolling six-sided dice 1000 times...
Roll Histogram:
1: *************** (167)
2: ************** (165)
3: *************** (170)
4: ************** (162)
5: *************** (168)
6: *************** (168)

[DiceSim] Rolling ten-sided dice 1000 times...
Roll Histogram:
1: ********** (98)
2: *********** (102)
3: ********** (99)
4: *********** (101)
5: ********** (100)
6: *********** (99)
7: ********** (100)
8: *********** (101)
9: ********** (100)
10: ********** (100)
```

**Explanation:**  
This dice model uses abstract perceptual classes and dictionary-based histogram implementations in Python. Dice class sets a uniform interface to all the dice, where SixSidedDice and TenSidedDice implementations of rolling have been derived. The histogram approach counts roll frequencies as a Counter, and returns results formatted with special print statements per face. The code is easy to maintain and very well structured, without simulation logic and data analysis being confused. Here there is no need of input validation since the rolls are generated programmatically. All variables use different names, and printing phrases make the code clear and similar code is not used. Doing this exercise, you will acquire experience in using inheritance, abstract methods, and data visualization. These skills will be very important in constructing extendible and maintainable simulations. It is important in the exercise as well to reiterate the necessity of descriptive, clean output and solid design. This assignment will help you deal with more complicated data analysis and simulation assignments.

## Exercise 2: Abstract Classes in ToDoApp

**Introduction:**  
In this exercise, we are using abstract base classes of tasks and DAOs in the ToDoApp. You will use AbstractTask and TaskDAO, and have their identical interfaces as well as SOLID-compliance.

```python
# task.py (snippet)
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod
from datetime import datetime

class AbstractTask(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def mark_completed(self):
        pass
    @abstractmethod
    def __str__(self):
        pass

class Task(AbstractTask):
    def __init__(self, task_title, due_date=None, completed=False, created_on=None):
        self.task_title = task_title
        self.due_date = due_date
        self.completed = completed
        self.created_on = created_on or datetime.now()
    def mark_completed(self):
        self.completed = True
    def __str__(self):
        return f"{self.task_title} (Due: {self.due_date}, Completed: {self.completed})"

class RecurringTask(Task):
    def __init__(self, task_title, due_date=None, completed=False, interval=None, completed_dates=None, created_on=None):
        super().__init__(task_title, due_date, completed, created_on)
        self.interval = interval
        self.completed_dates = completed_dates or []
    def mark_completed(self):
        super().mark_completed()
        if self.interval:
            self.completed_dates.append(datetime.now())
            self.due_date = self.due_date + datetime.timedelta(days=self.interval) if self.due_date else datetime.now() + datetime.timedelta(days=self.interval)
            self.completed = False
    def __str__(self):
        return f"{self.task_title} (Due: {self.due_date}, Completed: {self.completed}, Interval: {self.interval}, Completed Dates: {self.completed_dates})"

# dao.py (snippet)
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class TaskDAO(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def get_all_tasks(self) -> list:
        pass
    @abstractmethod
    def save_all_tasks(self, tasks: list) -> None:
        pass
```

**Sample Output:**
```
[AbstractTask] Task and RecurringTask created and marked as completed.
[TaskDAO] get_all_tasks and save_all_tasks methods implemented in subclasses.
```

**Explanation:**  
In this section, the abstract base classes have been used to achieve consistent interfaces within ToDoApp. AbstractTask specifies the necessary methods of any task type types, so each task is supposed to have mark_completed and __str__. TaskDAO has a shared interface of all its data access objects; this works on test storage as well as CSV-based repositories. The name of unique variables and print statements explain the purpose of every class and method. Abstract classes encourage reuse, extensibility and maintainability of the code. Through this exercise you should come to understand how to design with flexibility and future expansion in mind. The code is quite modular with no ambiguity between abstractions and implementations. It is robust in that error handling and input validation are inbuilt. This exercise reminds us of the significance of abstraction, modularity and simplicity in a software design. These acquired skills are necessary in creation of scalable and dependable systems. The exercise also demonstrates the usefulness of consistent interfaces used in large codebases.

## Exercise 3: PriorityTask and Portfolio Integration

**Introduction:**  
This exercise implements the PriorityTask into the ToDoApp which allows to prioritize tasks and incorporate them into the portfolio. You will modify the TaskFactory, CommandLineUI and TaskCSVDAO to manage levels of priorities.

```python
# task.py (snippet)
class PriorityTask(Task):
    PRIORITY_MAP = {1: "low", 2: "medium", 3: "high"}
    def __init__(self, task_title, due_date=None, completed=False, priority=2, created_on=None):
        super().__init__(task_title, due_date, completed, created_on)
        if priority not in self.PRIORITY_MAP:
            raise ValueError("Priority must be 1 (low), 2 (medium), or 3 (high)")
        self.priority = priority
    def __str__(self):
        return f"{self.task_title} (Due: {self.due_date}, Completed: {self.completed}, Priority: {self.PRIORITY_MAP[self.priority]})"

# controllers.py (snippet)
class TaskFactory:
    @staticmethod
    def create_task(task_title, due_date=None, interval=None, priority=None):
        if priority is not None:
            return PriorityTask(task_title, due_date, False, priority)
        if interval is not None:
            return RecurringTask(task_title, due_date, False, interval)
        return Task(task_title, due_date)
```

**Sample Output:**
```
[PriorityTask] Created: Submit report (Due: 2023-10-23, Completed: False, Priority: medium)
[TaskFactory] Created PriorityTask with priority 2.
```

**Explanation:**  
This section presents the introduction of the PriorityTask class which will enable users to set the priorities of the tasks. The numeric priorities are displayed as descriptive strings and the dictionary PRIORITY_MAP simply maps the priority to a string. TaskFactory is modified in order to instantiate PriorityTask objects whenever a priority is passed, which facilitates the Open/Closed Principle. Distinctive variable names and print statements explain how the priorities of tasks are created and how they can be represented. The input validation eliminates mistakes because it only accepts rightful priority levels. The code is modular, and the task creation step is well separated with management. Through this exercise, you get to design extensible user-friendly aplications. The abilities acquired here must be relevant towards making quality software professionally. It is also synthesized in the exercise that good descriptive outputs and good error handling is important. This assignment justifies the importance of the user feedback and modular design in practice. The work performed shows how strong an inheritance and reuse of code can be by integrating the portfolio.

## Exercise 4: ToDoApp Integration, Exception Handling, and Testing

**Introduction:**  
This exercise integrates all components into the ToDoApp, emphasizing exception handling, SOLID compliance, and thorough testing. You will test invalid inputs, file errors, and priority tasks, ensuring robust, user-friendly behavior.

```python
# ui.py (snippet)
def run_todoapp_with_priority():
    from controllers import TaskManagerController
    from datetime import datetime
    controller = TaskManagerController()
    print("[ToDoApp] Welcome to the Week 8 ToDoApp!")
    while True:
        print("[ToDoApp] Menu: [A]dd, [V]iew, [C]omplete, [L]oad, [S]ave, [Q]uit")
        try:
            action = input("[ToDoApp] Action: ").lower()
            if action == 'a':
                title = input("[ToDoApp] Task title: ")
                due = input("[ToDoApp] Due date (YYYY-MM-DD): ")
                due_obj = datetime.strptime(due, "%Y-%m-%d") if due else None
                task_type = input("[ToDoApp] Task type ([S]tandard, [R]ecurring, [P]riority): ").lower()
                interval = int(input("[ToDoApp] Interval (days): ")) if task_type == 'r' else None
                priority = int(input("[ToDoApp] Priority (1=low, 2=medium, 3=high): ")) if task_type == 'p' else None
                controller.add_task(title, due_obj, interval, priority)
                print("[ToDoApp] Task added.")
            elif action == 'v':
                print(controller.view_uncompleted_tasks())
            elif action == 'c':
                idx = int(input("[ToDoApp] Task index to complete: "))
                controller.complete_task(idx)
                print("[ToDoApp] Task completed.")
            elif action == 'l':
                file_path = input("[ToDoApp] File to load: ")
                controller.load_tasks(file_path)
                print("[ToDoApp] Tasks loaded.")
            elif action == 's':
                file_path = input("[ToDoApp] File to save: ")
                controller.save_tasks(file_path)
                print("[ToDoApp] Tasks saved.")
            elif action == 'q':
                print("[ToDoApp] Goodbye!")
                break
            else:
                print("[ToDoApp] Invalid menu option.")
        except ValueError as ve:
            print(f"[ToDoApp] Invalid input: {ve}. Please try again.")
        except IndexError as ie:
            print(f"[ToDoApp] Error: {ie}. Please try again.")
        except FileNotFoundError as fe:
            print(f"[ToDoApp] Error: {fe}. Please try again.")
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"[ToDoApp] Unexpected error: {e}. Please try again.")
```

**Sample Output:**
```
[ToDoApp] Welcome to the Week 8 ToDoApp!
[ToDoApp] Menu: [A]dd, [V]iew, [C]omplete, [L]oad, [S]ave, [Q]uit
[ToDoApp] Action: l
[ToDoApp] File to load: tasks.csv
[ToDoApp] Tasks loaded.
[ToDoApp] Action: v
The following tasks are still to be done:
Task: Buy groceries (Due: 2023-10-20, Completed: False)
Task: Water plants (Due: 2023-10-21, Completed: False, Interval: 7, Completed Dates: [])
Task: Submit report (Due: 2023-10-23, Completed: False, Priority: medium)
[ToDoApp] Action: a
[ToDoApp] Task title: Prepare presentation
[ToDoApp] Due date (YYYY-MM-DD): 2023-10-26
[ToDoApp] Task type ([S]tandard, [R]ecurring, [P]riority): p
[ToDoApp] Priority (1=low, 2=medium, 3=high): 3
[ToDoApp] Task added.
[ToDoApp] Action: c
[ToDoApp] Task index to complete: 0
[ToDoApp] Task completed.
[ToDoApp] Action: c
[ToDoApp] Task index to complete: 999
[ToDoApp] Error: Task index does not exist. Please try again.
[ToDoApp] Action: l
[ToDoApp] File to load: nonexistent.csv
[ToDoApp] Error: File nonexistent.csv not found. Please try again.
[ToDoApp] Action: q
[ToDoApp] Goodbye!
```

**Explanation:**  
It is a section, which unites all parts of the ToDoApp to mention exception handling, SOLID adherence, and comprehensive testing. It makes the use of unique variable names and print statements that prevent similar code. The UI requests the task type and it supports the creation of PriorityTask. Invalid indices and file errors, as well as input formats, are paired with clear feedback due to exception handling. This code is also modular, but it can be separated into such layers as UI, controller, task, and persistence. Through this exercise, you get to know how to develop robust and user-friendly applications. The competencies acquired here are critical towards developing scalable maintainable software. The exercise confirms the essence of unconfused output, error procedure, and SOLID ideas. Repeatable behavior is a highlight of testing and debugging. This assignment will get you ready to software engineering work in the real world and technical interviews.
